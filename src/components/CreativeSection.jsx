                    Iâ€™m continually expanding my expertise in React.js, Ruby on Rails, and JavaScript. Currently, 60% of my work focuses on personal projects that deepen my skills and solidify the knowledge gained from various bootcamps, while 40% is dedicated to freelance work. </p>

                I also manage an e-commerce website that I developed, which now generates over $25,000 in monthly revenue. Whether collaborating with former classmates, cross-functional teams, or independently driving projects, I set strict deadlines and benchmark goals, mirroring the structure of an Agile environment.
